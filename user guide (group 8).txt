Requirements:
	*** To run the code java and XML DOM need to be installed. ***
	To install on a linux (ubuntu) environment the following can be used:

		sudo apt-get install default-jdk

		sudo apt-get install libxml-dom-perl

User Guide:

Due to possible conflict associated with merging the different branches group 8 has opted to supply three seperate folders along with the algorithm design document. Each of the folders will have one of the following names (FF,BF,WF) for the corresponding algorithm implemented.

To test/run the each algorithm you will need to:

	1st move the test files relevant to that algorithm  into the algorithm's folder including the server files.

	2nd run the server.

	3rd use a terminal window with  and type "./run.sh".
		NOTE: in the case where you recieve a permission denied when trying to run "./run.sh", you will first need to use "chmod +x run.sh" then on the next line retype "./run.sh".

		This will compile the java files within the folder and run the Main.class (java Main -a #), where # is either ff, bf, wf.
